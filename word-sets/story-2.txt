=== ENDINGS ===
And justice was delivered in public.
And power changed hands forever.
And the enemy fell at his feet.
And the crowd roared in approval.
And revenge was finally complete.
And honour was restored before all.
And the villain realised too late.
And the truth exploded on stage.
And the throne belonged to him again.
And fear changed sides that day.
And the legend returned stronger.
And history bowed to his will.
And the past was crushed underfoot.
And silence followed the final blow.
And the name was spoken with respect again.
And the enemy begged for mercy.
And the masses chose their hero.
And the final word belonged to him.
